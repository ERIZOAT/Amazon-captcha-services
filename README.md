## What is Funcaptcha?

Funcaptcha is a type of CAPTCHA technology that was developed by a company called Arkose Labs. Unlike traditional CAPTCHAs, Funcaptcha uses interactive puzzles and games to differentiate between humans and bots. These puzzles are designed to be engaging and fun for humans, but difficult for bots to solve.
